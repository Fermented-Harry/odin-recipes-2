            <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>

            <o class="para">
                <li>First, marinate your chicken breasts in the spices of your choice, I usually use salt, paprika, 
                    sugar and lime juice.
                </li>

                <li>Marinate your chicken breasts for half an hour, 1 hour, or even overnight. Your decision></li>

                <li>Get three plates and put the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in each plate.</li>

                <li>Take your chicken and dip it in the eggs first. 
                    Make sure you get every part of the chicken covered in egg.
                </li>

                <li>Then place it in the flour and cover every part of it too. When you're done with that, 
                    repeat again but in the breadcrumbs.
                </li>

                <li>Place it aside and continue with the rest of the chicken</li>

                <li>Fry in oil at medium heat for about 3 minutes each side, or until golden brown.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="para">And there you have it! Beautifully gold, crispy and tender chicken breasts.</p>
