        <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>

        <ol class="para">
            <li>First of all, we have to cook our rice. Old rice from last night works best because it has 
                become stale and can soak more moisture and flavor. However, if you're gonna cook the rice 
                now, it is perfectly fine too.
            </li>

            <li>While your rice is cooking, put some oil in a pan or wok. When the oil is hot, place in your 
                diced onions and garlics. Put your meat when the onions and garlics are soft and stir fry till 
                cooked.
            </li>

            <li>Put in your vegetables next.</li>

            <li>When they are all finally cooked, put your rice in and stir well. A bit after putting rice, crack 
                an egg or two in the pan.
            </li>

            <li>Mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="para">Enjoy this tasty meal while it's still hot!</p>
