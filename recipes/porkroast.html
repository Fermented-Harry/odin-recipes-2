            <li>Rub your salt into the skinside of the pork. Make sure to really rub in carefully between each slit.</li>
            <li>Now on the meat-side, rub in your salt, sugar and paprika. Let this sit for a few minutes or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celcius.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to bake, place your pork belly on a grill, and your sliced potatoes on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Season the potatoes with some salt and some oil; just enough to not stick the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Place everthing in the oven for around 30 minutes. You might want to flip the potatoes around 10 minutes to even the cooking.</li>
        </ol>
